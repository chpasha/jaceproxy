- play certain files from torrent with multiple files?
  LoadAsync and then return m3u instead of octet/stream?
  but how tvheadend will react?
- if stopping torrent file, videostream doesn't get empty content and exits only on timeout. should we track clients?
  like in StopHandler?
- print help for urls
- send SETOPTIONS use_stop_notifications=1 ???
- memory usage - create memory dump and check most usages (e.g. lot of strings)
