- detect timeout
- parallel stream do not work, same event loop? they do work, timeout causing problems?
- restart on timeout
- respond to shutdown event
- test cases when acestream not running or stopped working abruptly
- parse requests contentid, torrent, etc
- client never stops if ace cannot load transport file
- on stop in player sometimes exceptions in chunkedwriter invalid ref count,
  maybe because of debug - we miss something while thread suspended
- EventLogger -> Handler?
- send SETOPTIONS use_stop_notifications=1 ???
- maybe ignore useless events, why instantiate classes and map properteis for smth like livepos?
- channel name in thread name?
- external config
- play same channel two clients?
- play certain files from torrent with multiple files?
- get rid of libs?
