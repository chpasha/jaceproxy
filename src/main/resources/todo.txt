- instead of Channel-Constructor args use ChannelGroups for all operations?
- timeout on waiting for stream from ace
- Unknown event received: INFO 1;Cannot find active peers
- print help for urls
- timeout for restart and if should restart as config params
- respond to shutdown event
- test cases when acestream not running or stopped working abruptly
- parse requests contentid, torrent, etc
- send SETOPTIONS use_stop_notifications=1 ???
- memory usage, any flaws? (- maybe ignore useless events, why instantiate classes and map properteis for smth like livepos?)
- play same channel two clients? See ChannelGroup
  create channel groups for unique infohash (or smth. unique for broadcast)
  and use them in downloader
- play certain files from torrent with multiple files?
  LoadAsync and then return m3u instead of octet/stream?
