- test cases when acestream not running or stopped working abruptly
- parse requests contentid, torrent, etc
- on stop in player sometimes exceptions in chunkedwriter invalid ref count,
  maybe because of debug - we miss something while thread suspended
- maybe ignore useless events, why instantiate classes and map properteis for smth like livepos?
- channel name in thread name?
- external config
- play same channel two clients?
- play certain files from torrent with multiple files?
